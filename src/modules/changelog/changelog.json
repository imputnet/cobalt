(closes #62, #66, #75, #88).\n*; added support for youtube dubs. currently it's using your browser's default language when enabled, but i have plans on making a picker. i'll ask people on twitter and mastodon if this feature is needed, and add a picker in next updates.\n*; instead of adding more quality presets, i added granular quality options. pick whatever you like, from 360p up to 4320p (for all services, not just youtube).\n*; replaced a format picker with codec picker for youtube. you can pick h264, av1, or vp9. all of them should work as expected (closes #88).\n*; youtube audio files are now properly matched to corresponding video files.\n*; it's now always possible to download pristine h264 720p/360p videos from youtube. these videos will work ANYWHERE, so they're default for mobile.\n*; youtube requests are no longer permanently cached, ram usage should drop even further.\n*; youtube video and audio file names now include codec and dub language when applicable.\n*; max video and audio duration limits have been bumped up to 3 hours.\n*; general performance of entire youtube download process has been greatly improved.\n*; vk module has been reworked to be more compact and not make use of outdated technique of quality picking. should also be way more reliable.\n\ninternal improvements:\n*; cleaned up services config, all constants have been moved directly to modules for quicker access.\n*; matching module has been slightly cleaned up.\n\ninterface improvements:\n*; many descriptions and error messages have been slightly tuned to be less wordy.\n*; unnecessary title duplications in settings have been merged into one.\n*; added more clarity to quality and codec descriptions.\n\nif you use cobalt api, please note that you have to update your creation to support new features.\n\nthis is the second batch of 5.x improvements, there's way more to come. thank you for being here, i really appreciate your support.\n\nif you want to thank me (the developer), there's a nice tab under this changelog that has \"donations\" text on it. anything helps me continue developing and hosting the friendliest media downloader :D"
