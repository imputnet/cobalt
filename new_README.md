### ethics

Cobalt is a tool that makes downloading public content easier. It takes **zero liability**.  
The end user is responsible for what they download, how they use, and distribute that content.  
Cobalt never caches any content; it [works like a fancy proxy](/api/src/stream/).

Cobalt is in no way a piracy tool and cannot be used as such.  
It can only download free and publicly accessible content.  
The same content can be downloaded via dev tools of any modern web browser.
