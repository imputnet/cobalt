### ethics
cobalt is a tool that makes downloading public content easier. it takes **zero liability**.
the end user is responsible for what they download, how they use and distribute that content.
cobalt never caches any content, it [works like a fancy proxy](/api/src/stream/).

cobalt is in no way a piracy tool and cannot be used as such.
it can only download free & publicly accessible content.
same content can be downloaded via dev tools of any modern web browser.
